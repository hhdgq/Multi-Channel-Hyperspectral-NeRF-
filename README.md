# Multi-Channel-Hyperspectral-NeRF-
This is the code for paper Multi-channel Volume Density Neural Radiance Field for Hyperspectral Imaging

There are two folders inside "/code"

The single channel code is the original method while the multi channel code is the method we proposed in the paper.
All our results were trained by codes here. 

An better intuition and a demo is coming soon, but our codes at this stage are complete.
